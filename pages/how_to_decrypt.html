            <ul>
                <li>
                    If it is an English letter: move it forward, circularly, at 3.<br>
                    For example, a becomes d, z becomes c, etc.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    If the character is a digit, we call it n, the character becomes its inverse digit relative to 10.<br>
                    For example, 9 becomes 1, 2 becomes 8, etc.<br>
                    0 will remain 0.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    If the character is a period or comma, and its position in the string is k,<br>
                    Then replace it with the character in the index m-k-1.<br>
                    For example, if the string is abcd. the new string will be .efgd when the dot is in 4th place
                    Replaced with the 0 character.<br>
                    Note that the following string: .a,<br>
                    Will become this string: ,d. <br>
                    That says, that the point and the comma were replaced only once.
                </li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
